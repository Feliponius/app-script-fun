Account Creation with email verification
Password Reset with email verification
Role-based Access: Director, Lead, Employee
Session Management with 6-hour TTL
2. Points Engine
Core Business Logic:
Milestone System: Automatic progression at 5, 10, 15 point thresholds
Probation Management: Automatic start/end, failure detection
Grace Period System: Complex credit/debit system for disciplinary actions
Positive Credit Ledger: Counter-balance system for mitigating actions
Rolling Point Calculations: 180-day window with effective points
Automatic PDF Generation: Milestone documents with Google Docs templates
3. PDF Document Generation

Employee History: Comprehensive PDF reports
Template System: Google Docs-based templates with token replacement
Automatic Linking: PDF links embedded in spreadsheet
4. Communication System
Slack Integration: Automated notifications to directors and docs channels
